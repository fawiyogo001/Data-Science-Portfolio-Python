## Variable Notes

- class: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)

  1st = Upper/High

  2nd = Middle

  3rd = Lower

- age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, it is in the form of xx.5

- sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in the following way:

  - Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
  - Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

- parch: The dataset defines family relations in the following way:

  - Parent = mother, father

  - Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

    Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
