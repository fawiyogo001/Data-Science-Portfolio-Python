# **Iris Classification**

## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">  
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

## Variable Notes

- Sepal (sɛp(ə)l; siːp(ə)l), *noun*. each of the parts of the calyx of a flower, enclosing the petals and typically green and leaflike.
- Petal (pɛt(ə)l), *noun*. each of the segments of the corolla of a flower, which are modified leaves and are typically colored.
