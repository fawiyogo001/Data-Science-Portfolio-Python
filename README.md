- <a href='https://github.com/fawiyogo001/Data-Science-Portfolio-Python/tree/master/E-Commerce%20Purchases'>E-Commerce Purchases</a>

  <div style="text-align: justify">Gaining insight of how current e-commerce system has affected customers' purchases as well as consumptions and thus, finding a way to improve the system. The analysis involves two datasets, customers data and purchases data for an analysis from customers' and purchases' point of view respectively.

  <div style="text-align: justify">Biologically classifying a flower with Genus name <i>Iris</i> into three different species: <i>Iris Setosa</i>, <i>Iris Versicolor</i>, and <i>Iris Virginica</i> using a dataset of observations performed by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936. The classification utilizes four properties: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- <a href='https://github.com/fawiyogo001/Data-Science-Portfolio-Python/tree/master/Spam%20Detection%20Filter'>Spam Detection Filter</a>

  <div style="text-align: justify">Using a data from a corpus which was collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS), this project unravels two types of message: ham which is the normal non-spam text message and spam which is the irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet (typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.). The exploration starts from the characteristics of a text message to its classification.

  <div style="text-align: justify"> 
      An analysis about the Titanic Tragedy in 1912, explores the general idea of what the dataset is about. While unraveling the causes of passengers' survival, this analysis will also show insights of how each variable such as sex, age and socio-economic status determine the passengers' survival.
